# OOP Encapsulation Project

## 📋 Description
This project demonstrates the concepts of **encapsulation** and **constructor overloading** in Java. It includes:
- A `Man` class with private attributes (`name`, `age`) and public getter and setter methods.
- A `Mantest` class containing the `main` method to test the functionality of the `Man` class.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Encapsulation**: Implementation of private fields with public accessor and mutator methods.
- **Constructor Overloading**: Includes both a default and parameterized constructor in the `Man` class.
- **Custom Methods**: 
  - `sayHello()`: Displays a greeting with the name and age of the person.
